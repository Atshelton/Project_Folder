# Project_Folder
## A list of all current and past projects for class

* This folder will contain all past and current projects for my class at The Iron Yard, I will continue to work on past projects to ensure that they become the best absolute product i can turn them into. As to reflect a solid portfolio and establish myself into the software developer community.
* I hope you like the projects and what the will turn into over the period of time that i will be learning to be a junior developer.

  * As of now this only contains my first project which will be to check one currency among another limited by those within a hash. Allowing you to add subtract or multiply those currencies as well as convert them to another type.
  
  *I Am new to this whole thing so please have patience and any input is welcome!*
